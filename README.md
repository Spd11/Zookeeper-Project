# Zookeeper-Project
 
 ## About
 This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

#### Learning outcomes
 This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
 
## Stages:

#### Stage #1: Rush into print

  There are many animals in the zoo: all of them need care, and some of them are endangered and require preservation efforts. Animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for such a big open-range zoo, so one of your employers suggested a better way to accomplish that. She wants to be able to watch any animal on the screen with the help of a special program.

In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeeper check on the animals and see that they're well. Your product will be able to understand commands from the zoo staff and show the animals on the monitor.To begin with, you should develop a simple printer. Your program must show the text from the output example.

#### Stage #2: Show me an animal!

  The important thing about working with animals is watching them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? At this time, we are ready to print something awesome: animal images! 
  
 In the second stage, you need to develop an animal printer. Your program should show a certain animal: you will find it in the code field.

Please, don't remove the r character at the start of the code template. It's a part of the string and it's important. So, the string should start with r""" sequence.

#### Stage #3: What's inside

  The third stage brings new abilities for your software: it will be able to recognize the number of a specific habitat from the input and show the animals living there.

Add all variables with images from the template to a variable with the type list. The order of variables matters: they must be in the order they're defined in the code. The list must contain all of them with no duplicates.

#### Stage #4: Sustainable care 3

  It's time to make your project more convenient and understandable. In this final stage, your software will be ready for use by the zoo staff. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work infinitely.
